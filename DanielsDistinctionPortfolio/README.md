### Microsoft Office Certification Program
<i>Fall 2019 - Spring 2022</i>
<br>
<br>The Daniels College of Business offers a Microsoft Office Certification Program that teaches Advanced Excel, Excel, Word, and PowerPoint classes, preparing students to pass the certification exams for each of these programs and to apply these skills in their classwork and professional work. After completing the classes and certification exams myself, I continued to utilize and expand upon these skills throughout my time at DU. My favorite part, was completing and receving a high score on my advanced certification exam for Excel, that was not required. I continued to help others throughout the course and developed mentoring relationships through this. Advancing in my major, I am grateful I took time to establish those skills.

### Academic Time Off 
#### Experience
<i>Fall 2023- Winter 2024</i>
<br>
<br>Taking time off from school for medical reasons was a challenging yet transformative experience that streghtned my resilience, perserverance, and ability to overcome adversity. Facing and navigating this period required immense courage, teaching me the value of grit and determination in the face of uncertainty. Throughout this journey, I developed a deeper understanding of perserverance - not only in pushing through personal hardships but also in maintaining a long-term vision for success. This experience enhanced my ability to mentor and support others, as I learned firsthand the importance of empathy, adaptability, and encouragment in overcoming obstacles. It also shifted my perspective on challenges, allowing me to approach difficult situations and confidence and a problem-solving mindset rather than intimidation. Most importantly, this period of growth reinforced my commitment to lifelong learning, as I returned to school stronger, more motivated, and equipped with a renewed perspective on resilience and personal development.

### Internship: Otolaryngology Associates - Accounting Department
<i>Summer 2022</i>
<br>
<br>The summer of 2022, I was an intern at Otolaryngology Associates, a private practice in Carmel, Indiana. I worked under the accounting department and I learned a great deal about my time there. During my accounting internship at Otolaryngology Associates, I took ownership of a data analysis project focused on streamlining records retention and data workflow. After receiving the conceptual framework and an introduction to the relevant systems, I worked independently while maintaining regular check-ins to discuss progress and address challenges.
<br>
<br>I demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by identifying outliers beyond the original project scope and adjusting my approach as needed. My ability to collaborate effectively with team members ensured buy-in for process improvments, distinguishing me from traditional consultants who often produce models without fostering integration. Additionally, I quickly grasped complex technical concepts and industry-specific terminology, showcasing a strong analytical mindset. My proactive communication kept stakeholders informed, and my adaptability allowed me to seamlessly shift gears when necessary. Overall, my professionalism, work ethic, and ability to balance independence with teamwork made a significant impact on the organization.

### Database Project: Silhouette Collective
<i>Spring 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my Foundations or Information Management class in Spring 2023, I was tasked with planning, designing, building, and programming aspects of an information management system using Microsoft Word (documentation), Visio (diagraming), and Access (relational database). This included designing a relational database, simulating data, building the relational database in Access, loading the data into the relational database, querying the relational database using SQL, and developing relational database forms and reports, including using VBA macros, functions, and sub procedures.
<br>
<br><i>Augst 2024</i>
<br>
<br>During my Enterprise Information Management class in Spring 2024, I expanded this relational database, adding tables and moving it to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This included designing, building, and programing an enterprise information management database using SQL Server and Azure; designing, building, and programing interactive forms using Visual Studio and SQL Server; and designing, building, and programing a Windows integrated application, along with reports, using Visual Studio and SQL Server. Throughout this process, I used SQL (build script, function, stored procedure, views, reports) and Visual Basic (forms).
<br>
<br>The fashion database, Silhouette Collective collects personal information from a client about size, brand preferences, color, etc. to create a customer profile that is assigned to a shopper within the company. The shopper can shop for specific events or just singular items per the consumer's request. The company is currently based in Colorado and looking to expand their market within its original region while slowly branching out to surrounding regions. Currently, the company just entered the market therefore its short-term goals are to breakeven. Long term goals would be to establish a strong presence in the market by gaining a lot of traction and customer loyalty. 

<br>Description of the Project:</b>This project will create a data mart for the company that allows it to collect and organize all their data. This data mart project is essential to the development of a large data warehouse because it establishes the fact tables and dimensions. The database is centered around orders, and the orders are measured by the total order amount. By establishing a data mart, Silhouette Collective will be able to increase performance, provide insights that support decision-making, and focus on insights for departments. As we are a startup company as well and have limited budget, a data mart is more cost-effective solution that a comprehensive data warehouse.

<br>Strategic Metrics:</b> The Silhouette Collective data mart will provide strategic metrics on number of customers served, total revenue, average order amount, and customer retention rate. Tracking these metrics will help inform the company of their customer's behabior and preferences as well as the performance and efficiency of their services.

<br>Business Questions to Answer:</b> 1. The CEO would like to know the total revenue of the company by month, quarter, and year. 2. The shopper manager would like to know the number of orders completed per month by each shopper. 3. The brand manager would like to know which brands are most popular by tracking the number of orders per month per brand. 4. The CEO would like to know if there is a special occasion or event that produces the most consistent number of orders or is it scattered. 5. The CEO would like to know the comparison between high value orders and low value orders and the quantity of orders associated with. 6. The CEO would like to know which regions of the country customer's are shooping from and how customer spending varies by region. These business requirement questions help different departments and managers within the company take insights from the data mart that can inform their decisions surrounding business strategies.

### Complex Data Analytics
<i>Winter 2025 </i>
<br>
<br>In my Complex Data Analytics class, I am currently working on a sentiment analysis project, leveraging advanced data processing techniques to extract and analyze emotions and opinions from textual data. This involves using natural language processing methods to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, allowing for deeper insights into trends, customer feedback, or public perception. Through this project, I am gaining hands on experience with machine learning models, data preprocessing, and text mining, enhancing my ability to work with unstructured data. Additionally, I am learning to interpret and visualize sentiment trends, ensuring data-driven decision making. This experience is strengthening my analytical skills, technical proficiency in tools like Python and sentiment analysis libraries, and my ability to translate raw data into actionale insights- an essential skill in business intelligence and strategic decision making.

<br> During my semester abroad in Prague, Czech Republic, I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture while expanding my global perspective. Living in Prague allowed me to experience its rich history, vibrant architecture, and diverse international community, all while continuing my academic studies. Beyond my time in the Czech Republic, I traveled to 10 other countries, exploring different cultures, customs, and ways of life across Europe. This experience strengthened my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to navigate unfamilar environments with confidence. I also expanded my fluency with Spanish and continued to learn the Czech language. Traveling extensively while balancing coursework taught me invaluable time managment and organizational skills, while also broadening my worldview. Engaging with diverse perspectives deepend my appreciation for cultural differences and enhanced my ability to communicate and collaborate across backgrounds. This transformative experience not only enriched my education but also developed my independence, resilience, and global awareness-qualities that will continue to shape my personal and professional growth.
